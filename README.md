# DOGS-VS-CATS-CLASSIFIER

# Description📄

This project trains a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras on the Dogs vs Cats dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and prediction generation for test images.

# Features✨

✅ Automatic dataset extraction

✅ Image augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip, etc.)

✅ CNN model for binary classification

✅ Training and validation split

✅ Accuracy visualization

✅ Saves model and predictions

# How It Works⚙️

1. Dataset Setup
Extracts the zip file and organizes images into training and test folders.

2. Preprocessing
Applies normalization and augmentation to images.

3. Model Architecture
A CNN with multiple convolution and pooling layers, followed by dense layers.

4. Training
Trains the model with validation monitoring.

5. Prediction
Predicts labels for test images and saves results to a CSV.

# Results 📊

✅ Model saved as: dogs_vs_cats_classifier.keras

✅ Predictions saved in: test_predictions.csv

✅ Accuracy plot shows training vs validation performance over 10 epochs
